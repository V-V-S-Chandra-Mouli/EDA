# EDA

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To understand the dataset better and gain meaningful insights, I performed a series of exploratory data analysis steps using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### Distribution Plots

1. **Quantity Distribution**
   - Plotted to understand the frequency of different order quantities.
   - Insight: Customers mostly order between 1 to 5 units, with 2 and 3 being slightly more frequent.

2. **Price Distribution**
   - Helped visualize the pricing spread of products.
   - Insight: Product prices are fairly evenly distributed from ₹0 to ₹500, with minor peaks around ₹100–₹150 and ₹300–₹350.

3. **Customer Age Distribution**
   - Visualized the age range of customers.
   - Insight: Customers are spread across ages 18 to 75, with notable groups in 20s, 30s, 50s, and 60s.

4. **Review Score Distribution**
   - Plotted to assess overall customer satisfaction.
   - Insight: Majority of reviews are 4 and 5 stars, indicating high customer satisfaction.
